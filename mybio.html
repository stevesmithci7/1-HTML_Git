    <p>I was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona. I grew up playing competitive tennis and I also had a great interest in computers from a young age. I taught myself to play guitar at the age of 15. I went to college in Flagstaff, Arizona at Northern Arizona University in 2000 when I was 18 years old. I played guitar in a rock band and took a break from school in 2003 to tour with this band. I returned to school in 2004 and majored in classical guitar. I eventually decided that I wanted to attend law school, and I changed my major to Business Management. I graduated with my bachelor's degree in Business Magement in 2007.</p>

    <p>I began law school at Phoenix School of Law (now known as Arizona Summit Law School) in 2007. I graduated from law school in May of 2010 and I passed the Arizona Bar Exam in July of 2010. My first job as a lawyer was practicing litigation at a large plaintiff's personal injury firm. In 2011 I left that job and created my own firm practicing Family Law, Personal Injury, and Civil Law. I eventually decided to focus my practice solely on Family Law, which consisted of Divorce and Custody matters. In the summer of 2017 I decided to close my firm and take a long and well deserved vacation. I also embarked on a new journey to find a new career. I decided that my next career would be computer coding, and I enrolled in the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp in March of 2018.</p>
